Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Swift.

## Implementation Notes

### [Day 1](advent-of-code-2021/AdventKit/Solvers/Solver01.swift)
This was a great chance to test out the [swift-algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) package.
Using a functional approach with the `adjacentPairs()` and `windows(ofCount:)` methods created very concise and readable code.
I quite enjoy looking at these two functions as opposed to looking at loops and if statements.
